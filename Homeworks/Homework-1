Write a shell script program (evenodd.sh) which adds the odd numbers in odd lines and adds the even numbers in even lines.
Write the result on the standard output! In each lines there are at least 2 numbers. The filename is given by a parameter.

perl -lne '$x= $. & 1; $z[$x] += $_ for grep {($_ & 1) == $x} /\d+/g;
           END { print "Sum of odd numbers on odd lines: " . (0+$z[1]);
          print "Sum of even numbers on even lines: " . (0+$z[0]); }' < $1
